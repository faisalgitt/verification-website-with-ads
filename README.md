# 🌌 StellarVerify – Secure Access Gateway

**StellarVerify** is a lightweight **verification landing page** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides a **two-step secure verification system** with ad integration, animations, and a modern UI — perfect for communities, Discord servers, or websites that want to gate premium content.


## ✨ Features
- 🎨 Modern responsive UI with gradients and animations
- 🌀 Interactive particle background (`particles.js`)
- 🔒 Secure two-step verification flow
- ⏳ Cooldown + countdown timers for better security
- 📊 Progress bar & success notification
- 📱 Fully responsive across all devices
- 🎭 Ad integration (banner + interstitial ready)
- 🤝 Discord server join button
- 💬 FAQ section for user support


## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **First Click** → Redirects user to your **first ad URL**  
2. **Cooldown (5s)** → User waits briefly  
3. **Second Click** → Opens an overlay with your **second ad URL** + 10s countdown  
4. **Completion** → Redirects user to your **real content URL**


## 🚀 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stellar-verify.git
   cd stellar-verify
Open index.html in any browser.

Configure the project by editing index.html:

🔗 Set your real content link (line ~870 in index.html):

const realLink = "https://your-real-url-here.com";


📢 Set your ad URLs (line ~875 in index.html):

const firstClickAd = "https://your-first-ad-url.com";
const secondClickAd = "https://your-second-ad-url.com";


💰 Replace embedded ad network scripts with your own (search for invoke.js in the file):

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://your-ad-network.com/invoke.js"></script>


Deploy the page

GitHub Pages: push your repo → Settings → Pages → set branch to main

⚡ This README is **ready-to-use**. You just need to replace:  
- `https://your-real-url-here.com` → with your **real destination link** (Discord, premium page, etc.)  
- `https://your-first-ad-url.com` and `https://your-second-ad-url.com` → with your **ad links**  
- `invoke.js` → with your **ad network script**  


Do you also want me to **edit your `index.html` file** so it already has comments like:  
```html
// TODO: Replace this with your real link
const realLink = "...";
